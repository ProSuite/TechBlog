# ProSuite Tech Blog

This is a blog of technical articles relating to
ProSuite, ArcGIS, Programming, and GIS in general.
It is mostly a mnemonic device for The ProSuite Authors,
but if anybody else finds it useful, that would please
us even more.

Built with Jekyll and hosted by GitHub Pages.
To **run locally**, install Ruby and Jekyll. Then
run *serve.bat* (which just invokes jekyll with
the proper arguments).
To **publish**, commit your articles and push to
the master branch on the GitHub repository.
One of the blog articles explains the setup and
usage of Jekyll and GitHub Pages in more detail.
